# Userscripts

Your Epupp userscripts live here. Each script is a `.cljs` file with a manifest map as the first form, followed by the script code. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the manifest format and available Scittle libraries.

## Syncing Scripts with Epupp

This directory is also a self-contained [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) project with tasks for syncing scripts between your local files and the Epupp browser extension storage. This lets you keep your scripts in version control and push/pull them to/from the browser.

All commands are run from the `userscripts/` directory and require:

1. The browser-nrepl relay running (start it from the project root with `bb browser-nrepl`)
2. A browser tab connected to Epupp
3. **FS REPL Sync** enabled in Epupp extension settings

### `bb download`

Download scripts from Epupp to local files. Built-in `epupp/` scripts are skipped.

```sh
bb download                          # all scripts
bb download pez                      # all scripts under pez/
bb download hq/hello_world.cljs      # specific script
bb download --force                  # overwrite existing local files
bb download --dry-run                # show what would happen
bb download --port 11331             # use a different relay port
```

### `bb upload`

Upload local scripts to Epupp. Scripts without a valid manifest are skipped with a warning.

```sh
bb upload                            # all scripts
bb upload hq                         # all scripts under hq/
bb upload hq/hello_world.cljs        # specific script
bb upload --force                    # overwrite existing scripts in Epupp
bb upload --dry-run                  # show what would happen
```

### `bb diff`

Compare local scripts against what's stored in Epupp. Produces unified diff output for scripts that differ, and a summary of identical, different, remote-only, and local-only scripts.

```sh
bb diff                              # all scripts
bb diff pez                          # all scripts under pez/
bb diff hq/hello_world.cljs          # specific script
```

### Path Arguments

Path arguments are relative to `userscripts/`. Any argument not ending in `.cljs` is treated as a directory prefix and expanded to all matching scripts. So `bb diff pez` and `bb diff pez/` both work.

### Ports

All commands default to port `1339`. Use `--port` to target a relay running on a different port, matching your per-domain port configuration in Epupp.
